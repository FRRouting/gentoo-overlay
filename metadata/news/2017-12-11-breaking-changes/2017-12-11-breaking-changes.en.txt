This overlay is currently undergoing some changes in all net-misc/frr ebuilds 
to obtain official and stable states from FRRouting.
As a result, ebuilds with the p1 version suffix are introduced which hold some 
breaking changes.

Changes are:
	- License change from `GPL-2` to `GPL-2+`
	- Creation of a new user, `frr`, instead of `quagga`
          Please make sure you chown all configuration files and directories 
          to the new user.
	- Creation of a unified init script called `frr`
          Please enable this initscript to ensure production upon reboot and
          disable the old init scripts, if any.

    PLEASE READ THROUGH ABOVE NEWS CAREFULLY, THESE CHANGES WILL BREAK YOUR
        PRODUCTION IF NOT ACTED UPON. APOLOGIES FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.
